Going to the crowd to complete tasks, find funding, or generate data is increasingly popular. While crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter.com or Kiva.com are frequently in the news, crowdsourcing is another common means of going to the crowd. As it is is commonly understood, crowdsourcing is process of going to the crowd in order to perform work. Examples you may be familiar with include [TK]. While crowdsourcing emerged before the advent of computer science, such as genealogical research, it is now prevalent throughout the business and academic worlds.

  You may be saying to yourself that this is all well and good, but what is a crowd? Why do I want to go to the crowd? How do I set up a crowdsourcing project? If you’re a more advanced user with some experience crowdsourcing, you may be curious about the best platform for your problem and the different worker skills in each platform.

  We decided to write this guide to help make crowdsourcing more user-friendly. There are so many people whose working life and research could be improved by going to the crowd, but who don’t feel comfortable programming or using crowd platforms. This contributes to the perception that crowdsourcing is “too technical” or “too advanced” for non-computer scientists. While this isn’t true, there is not currently a good, non-technical primer to setting up crowdsourcing tasks and determining the accuracy and reproducibility of crowdsourced data. By completing this guide’s step-by-step instructions, we hope that you will 1) feel more comfortable programming and 2) feel at ease posting your crowd tasks onto common platforms. This guideline assumes no technical knowledge beyond the ability to think creatively and read through code with comments included.

  We proceed as follows. First, we define and discuss some jargon so that we can be sure our readers are familiar with the terms used by the crowd community. Second, we include instructions for setting up accounts and posting tasks to several common crowd platforms. Within this section, we discuss the pros and cons of each platform in order to help you make an educated decision about the best host for your project. Third, we present some basic tasks and their code. Finally, we [TK].
